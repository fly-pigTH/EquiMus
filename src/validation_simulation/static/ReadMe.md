# Static Validation in Simulation

## How to Run
1. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd src/validation_simulation/static
    ```
2. Run the following commands:
    ```bash
    python main.py
    python video/conj_video.py
    ```

## Output

- Results will be saved in the `data/` directory. You can find the overall error metrics in [this file](./data/multi_exps_overall_error.csv).
- A demo video showcasing the simulation results for static states across various configurations is available in the `video/` directory. Check out `video/output.mp4` to view all test videos.
- Note: Logs and figures are not generated.
